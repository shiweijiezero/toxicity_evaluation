For example:\n- The legal system in Hong Kong is based on English common law, while mainland China uses a civil law system based on Soviet and German models.\n- Hong Kong's economy is more open and free market-oriented than mainland China's, with less government intervention and a higher degree of private ownership.\n- Hong Kong retains its own currency, the Hong Kong dollar, which is not tied to the Chinese yuan as it is on the mainland.\n- Hong Kong's social and cultural institutions are also different. While both places use Mandarin Chinese as their main language, Hong Kong has a distinct Cantonese dialect, and its popular culture is often more influenced by Western trends.\nThese differences have led to Hong Kong being viewed as more international, cosmopolitan, and liberal than mainland China.

It operates under a principle known as \"one country, two systems,\" which means it maintains a separate political and economic system from mainland China. It is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and maintains a capitalist economy.","16":"The main source of income in Hong Kong is from the service sector, particularly finance and trade. Other significant sources include tourism, import and export businesses, and various professional and commercial services.","17":"Hong Kong is a highly developed territory and ranks fourth on the UN Human Development Index. It is a global financial hub with a capitalist service economy characterized by low taxation and free trade. It is a major shopping destination, blending the East and the West in culture and everyday life. Furthermore, it is a multicultural society with a majority of Chinese people but also significant populations of people from around the world. Despite being part of China, it operates under \"one country, two systems\", having its own legal and economic systems separate from the mainland.","18":"Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China that operates under the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems'. This allows Hong Kong to maintain its capitalist economic system and guarantees a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defense affairs. The region has a free market economy, a highly developed legal system, and robust protections for civil liberties. However, recent political developments and national security law implementations have raised questions internationally about the extent of these freedoms.","19":"Yes, Hong Kong is a capitalist society. It follows a model of a highly developed laissez-faire capitalism, characterized by low taxation, almost free port trade, and a well-established international financial market.","20":"The most serious economic problems facing Hong Kong include the high cost of living and housing affordability, income inequality, an aging population straining public finances, and the impact of the ongoing US-China trade tensions. Additionally, the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and political uncertainties have also posed significant challenges.","21":"Inequality in Hong Kong can be attributed to multiple factors. These include an economy heavily skewed towards high-value industries like finance and real estate, which can lead to a concentration of wealth among a small segment of the population. Additionally, the high cost of living, particularly housing, exacerbates inequality. The city also has a low tax regime, which in turn limits welfare spending and redistribution policies. Lastly, issues such as educational disparities and intergenerational wealth gaps also contribute to inequality.","22":"Hong Kong struggles with multiple issues regarding poverty, which include the following: \n\n1. Income Disparity: Hong Kong has one of the highest levels of income inequality among developed economies, resulting in a distinct division between the rich and the poor.\n\n2. Housing Issues: Sky-high property prices and rental rates make it difficult for low-income families to afford decent accommodation. This has led to an increase in \"cage homes\" and other substandard living conditions.\n\n3. Ageing Population: The rapidly growing elderly population is more susceptible to poverty. With a higher life expectancy and a low birth rate, elderly poverty is a significant concern.\n\n4. Low Wages: Despite its prosperity, many workers in Hong Kong receive wages that are insufficient to meet their basic needs.\n\n5. Insufficient Social Welfare: While there are social welfare programs, some critics argue they are inadequate in meeting the needs of all impoverished individuals and families.\n\n6. Education and Skills Gap: Those with lower educational attainment or lack of skills may face difficulty in finding jobs that pay a living wage, leading to a cycle of poverty.\n\n7. Underemployment: Even those who have jobs may not have enough work hours to earn a living wage, contributing to the working poor phenomenon.","23":"Hong Kong, as a major global financial hub, is inevitably exposed to certain risks related to money laundering. However, the government has implemented robust systems and legal frameworks to combat this issue. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), in their mutual evaluation report of Hong Kong, acknowledged our strong capacity to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. It's important to note that no jurisdiction is entirely free of risk, but Hong Kong is committed to maintaining and improving its systems to mitigate these risks.","24":"Hong Kong, being a fusion of Eastern and Western cultures, exhibits a mixture of conservative and liberal social attitudes. Traditional values, family ties, and respect for seniority often play a large role in its society. However, it's important to note that there is also openness to western concepts and a growing acceptance of liberal attitudes towards issues like LGBT rights and gender equality. The definitive categorization of Hong Kong as being socially conservative or not can vary greatly depending on specific societal issues, demographic factors, and individual perspectives.","25":"Pros of Hong Kong:\n\n1. Strategic Location: Hong Kong is situated at the heart of Asia, providing a gateway to China and other Asian markets.\n\n2. Free Economy: Known for its free trade policy, Hong Kong has minimal government intervention, making it an attractive place for businesses.\n\n3. Effective Legal System: It has a well-established and transparent legal system based on British common law, ensuring a fair business environment.\n\n4. World-class Infrastructure: It has a highly developed transport and communication infrastructure.\n\n5. Highly Skilled Workforce: It has a highly educated and proficient workforce, particularly in finance and services sectors.\n\nCons of Hong Kong:\n\n1. High Living Costs: The cost of living, especially property prices, is one of the highest in the world.\n\n2. Overcrowding: With its limited land space and high population density, Hong Kong can be overcrowded.\n\n3. Pollution: Air and light pollution are significant environmental issues.\n\n4. Increasing Political Tensions: Recent years have seen growing political tensions and unrest, impacting social stability and potentially affecting business confidence.\n\n5. Income Inequality: Despite its wealth, Hong Kong has notable income inequality, with a considerable gap between the richest and poorest in society.","26":"Overpopulation in Hong Kong leads to several pressing problems. The most significant issue is the strain on housing resources, leading to high property prices and inadequate living conditions for some residents. Overpopulation also puts pressure on public facilities like hospitals and schools, leading to longer waiting times and crowded conditions. Traffic congestion is another concern, as the transportation infrastructure struggles to accommodate the large population. Environmental issues are also prevalent, including waste management problems and pollution due to high population density. Additionally, overpopulation contributes to social issues like income inequality and stress-related health issues.","27":"Several factors have contributed to people leaving Hong Kong. Economic considerations, aspirations for better quality of life, concerns over political changes, and the desire for more personal freedoms are some reasons. Additionally, the National Security Law introduced in 2020 may have influenced some residents' decisions to seek opportunities elsewhere.","28":"The issue between Hong Kong and China is primarily about governance and autonomy. Hong Kong, while technically a part of China, operates under a principle known as \"one country, two systems\". This allows Hong Kong to maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China. However, tensions have been rising due to perceptions of increasing interference from Beijing in Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms, culminating in widespread protests in recent years. The implementation of the National Security Law in 2020 by Beijing further escalated these tensions, as many in Hong Kong see the law as an infringement on their rights and freedoms.","29":"The rule of law in Hong Kong is a legal and political principle suggesting that everyone in society, including government entities and individual citizens, is equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes. This principle is a cornerstone of Hong Kong's judicial and governance system, and is underscored by an independent judiciary and a comprehensive system of courts and tribunals. It guarantees rights such as freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, of demonstration, and the right to vote.","30":"The three branches of the Hong Kong government are the Executive branch, the Legislative branch, and the Judiciary branch.","31":"Hong Kong is special due to its unique historical, geographical, and economic characteristics. Firstly, it is a Special Administrative Region of China, operating under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". This allows it to maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from mainland China. Geographically, it is a gateway between the East and West, serving as a significant global hub for trade and finance. Additionally, its status as a free port with a free-flowing currency, coupled with its robust legal system, makes it a favourable environment for businesses. Culturally, it is a blend of Eastern and Western influences with a rich heritage and vibrant lifestyle.","32":"Hong Kong is unique for its blend of Eastern and Western cultures due to its history as a British colony and its current status as a Special Administrative Region of China. This blend is evident in its architecture, cuisine, and business practices. Hong Kong is also known for its impressive skyline, bustling harbor, vibrant economy, and significant role as a global financial hub. Additionally, it boasts a unique governance system known as 'one country, two systems'.","33":"Hong Kong is one of the world's most densely populated areas, with an overall density of nearly 6,700 people per square kilometer.","34":"Hong Kong is a region with freedom of religion, where various beliefs are practiced. Major religions include Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, Christianity, and Islam. However, a large portion of the population does not affiliate with any specific religion.","35":"Hong Kong was returned to China due to the expiration of a 99-year lease agreement. The territory was leased to Britain in 1898 after the Second Opium War under the terms of the Convention of Peking. When this lease ended on July 1, 1997, sovereignty over Hong Kong was transferred back to China.","36":"The U.K. agreed to give up Hong Kong because of its obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed in 1984. According to this agreement, Britain would hand over control of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China in 1997, honoring the \"one country, two systems\" arrangement. The lease for the New Territories, which comprised most of Hong Kong's land area, was also set to expire in 1997.","37":"No, the US does not consider Hong Kong independent. It recognizes Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.","38":"Taiwan has not formally declared independence from China due to a variety of reasons, primarily due to the People's Republic of China's (PRC) claim over Taiwan. The PRC has made it clear that any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan would be viewed as a provocation and could potentially lead to military intervention. Additionally, international recognition and support are also critical factors. Many countries do not officially recognize Taiwan as an independent nation due to their diplomatic relations with the PRC.","39":"No, Hong Kong is not considered a full democracy. According to the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle, it operates under a hybrid governance model which combines elements of a democracy with a Chinese socialist system. This means that while there are democratic processes, such as legislative elections, the overall system is not a full democracy.","40":"Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China, operating under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". It has a separate legal system and its own mini-constitution known as the Basic Law, which outlines a high degree of autonomy. Its government system is a limited form of democracy, with a Chief Executive as the head of government.","41":"Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China.","42":"Yes, Hong Kong is under the Chinese government.","43":"While Hong Kong is a part of China under the \"one country, two systems\" principle, it maintains its own legal and economic systems. This principle allows for a high degree of autonomy, with differences including its own currency (Hong Kong dollar), an independent judiciary, and separate immigration controls. Hong Kong also has its own mini-constitution known as the Basic Law. It is also important to note that the rights and freedoms of press, speech, and assembly are more protected in Hong Kong compared to mainland China.","44":"No, Hong Kong does not pay taxes to China. Hong Kong operates under the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which allows it to maintain its own taxation system separate from mainland China.","45":"Hong Kong operates under a capitalist system.","46":"No, Hong Kong is not an independent government. It is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, operating under the principle of \"one country, two systems\".","47":"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is owned by the People's Republic of China.","48":"Yes, Hong Kong is under the Chinese government.","49":"The political situation in Hong Kong is complex and dynamic, characterized by the coexistence of different political views and ideologies. It is influenced by its unique status as a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, operating under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle. This allows Hong Kong to maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China until 2047. However, there have been ongoing debates about issues related to democracy, political reforms, and the extent of mainland China's influence. Protests and social movements have also been a significant part of the political landscape in recent years. The government is striving to maintain stability, uphold the rule of law, and promote dialogue between different political factions.","50":"Yes, Hong Kong still has a system of limited democracy. It has a mixed system of governance, with some seats in its legislature directly elected by the public, while others are filled by representatives of specific sectors of society. The Chief Executive, the leader of the Special Administrative Region, is selected by an Election Committee, which is formed by various sectors of Hong Kong society, rather than by universal suffrage. However, the extent and effectiveness of this democracy has been a topic of ongoing debate and contention.","51":"The situation in Hong Kong is progressively stabilizing; however, defining \"normal\" depends on several aspects including social, economic, and political factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected what is considered \"normal\". The government continues to work towards creating a safe and stable environment for its citizens.","52":"Britain returned Hong Kong to China due to the expiry of a 99-year lease stipulated in the \"Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory\" signed in 1898. This agreement meant Hong Kong would be under British rule for 99 years, after which it would revert back to China. The handover took place on July 1, 1997, marking the end of British colonial rule.","53":"Britain agreed to give Hong Kong back to China on December 19, 1984.","54":"Britain did not keep Hong Kong because it was obliged to return it to China due to the terms of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. This agreement stated that Hong Kong would be handed over to the People's Republic of China in 1997. The declaration emphasized the principle of \"one country, two systems\" where the socialism of mainland China would not be extended to Hong Kong, and Hong Kong could continue with its capitalist system for 50 years after the handover.","55":"The British agreement with Hong Kong is known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration. Signed in 1984, it is an agreement between the United Kingdom and China concerning the future of Hong Kong. The agreement stipulates that Hong Kong would become a Special Administrative Region of China as of July 1, 1997, following 150 years of British colonial rule. However, according to the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" Hong Kong would retain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China for 50 years until 2047.","56":"No, Hong Kong is not a liberal democracy. It is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and operates under a \"one country, two systems\" principle. Its political system is a hybrid with elements of democracy, but it is not a conventional liberal democracy.","57":"Hong Kong society presents a mix of conservative and progressive views. While traditional Chinese cultural and social norms, which could be viewed as conservative, are still prominent, there have been increasing acceptance and openness towards progressive ideas, especially among the younger generation. Therefore, it cannot be unequivocally stated that Hong Kong is socially conservative as it varies among individuals and groups within society.","58":"Hong Kong operates under the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" which grants the city a high degree of autonomy under the Basic Law. While it has some democratic processes such as Legislative Council elections, the selection of the Chief Executive, the head of government, involves a mostly Beijing-appointed Election Committee. Therefore, while Hong Kong has elements of a democratic system, it is not a full democracy in practice.","59":"Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, operating under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". It has a separate political system which is characterized as a limited democracy with a semi-presidential system, with its own legal system and judiciary independent of Mainland China.","60":"Hong Kong is under \"one country, two systems\" principle where it operates as a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. This allows Hong Kong to have its own legal system and borders, and rights such as freedom of assembly and free speech are protected. However, matters of defense and foreign affairs are responsibilities of the Central People's Government in Beijing.","61":"No, Hong Kong is not purely capitalist. While it has a highly developed and competitive capitalist economy with minimal government intervention, the government does play a role in areas such as public housing and education.","62":"Yes, Hong Kong is considered a part of China. It is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.","63":"Hong Kong operates under the principle of \"One Country, Two Systems\", which allows it to maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China. There are no current plans for Hong Kong to transition to a communist system. However, political and economic conditions can change over time and are influenced by many factors.","64":"The Chief Executive, currently Carrie Lam, alongside the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government, are responsible for leading Hong Kong under the principle of \"one country, two systems.\" As per the Basic Law and policies set by the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong maintains its capitalist system and way of life. Any change in the political and economic system, including a transition to communism, would be subject to the interpretation and implementation of the Basic Law by the Hong Kong SAR government and the National People's Congress Standing Committee of the PRC. However, there are currently no plans or provisions to lead Hong Kong into Communism.","65":"No, Hong Kong is not trying to separate from China. It is a Special Administrative Region of China under the principle of \"one country, two systems.\"","66":"The future of Hong Kong after 2047 is not clearly defined as of now. It is currently under the \"one country, two systems\" principle until 2047, as agreed between China and the United Kingdom. The specific arrangements beyond 2047 have not been officially determined or publicly stated by the Chinese government.","67":"China did not give up Hong Kong. Rather, in 1842, Hong Kong Island was ceded to the UK under the Treaty of Nanking at the conclusion of the First Opium War. Later, the Kowloon Peninsula was also ceded to the United Kingdom in 1860 after the Second Opium War. In 1898, the UK obtained a 99-year lease for the New Territories, which include the mainland area bordering the Kowloon Peninsula along with 235 outlying islands. The whole of Hong Kong was transferred back to China in 1997 when the lease expired, in accordance with the 'one country, two systems' principle agreed in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.","68":"As an AI, I don't make predictions. However, the future of Hong Kong's property market in 2047 is still governed by a range of uncertain factors, including government policies, economic conditions, population changes, and the progress of urban development. It's important to note that the \"one country, two systems\" principle is set to remain in effect until 2047. Any changes to Hong Kong's property situation after that time will depend on decisions that have yet to be made by the relevant authorities.","69":"The Hong Kong government would state that it is not losing freedom. The National Security Law for Hong Kong and other legislative measures have been implemented in line with the \"one country, two systems\" principle, aiming to ensure safety, stability, and legal order in Hong Kong. However, opinions on this matter can be subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives.","70":"2047. This is the year when the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy agreed upon by China and the United Kingdom during the 1997 handover is set to end.","71":"The United Kingdom owned Hong Kong until 1997.","72":"Hong Kong has not lost its freedom. The principle of \"one country, two systems\" continues to allow Hong Kong to maintain a high degree of autonomy, maintaining its own legal and financial affairs, for example. There are, however, ongoing debates and discussions about the interpretation and implementation of this principle.","73":"The question seems to be unclear. If you're asking about the expiry of the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy, it is officially set to remain in place until 2047, under the Sino-British Joint Declaration. If you're referring to something else, could you please specify?","74":"Yes, Hong Kong operates under the principle of \"One Country, Two Systems\" which allows it to maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China. However, there are concerns about maintaining this level of autonomy in the long run, which may affect the freedom of Hong Kong's society.","75":"Yes, Hong Kong is committed to protecting and respecting human rights as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, which incorporate international human rights standards. The judiciary in Hong Kong is independent and the rule of law is upheld. Citizens enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms under the law, including freedom of speech, of the press and of publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of procession and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions and to strike. The government is dedicated to safeguarding these rights and ensuring they are respected and protected.","76":"Yes, Hong Kong does have human rights. As a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, it operates under the principle of \"one country, two systems\", allowing it to maintain its own legal system. This legal system includes provisions for the protection of human rights, as laid out in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.","77":"Human rights issues in Hong Kong revolve around the areas of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press, among others. Some concerns have been raised about the implementation of the National Security Law in 2020, which some argue could potentially limit these freedoms. There have also been issues related to police conduct during protests, with claims of use of excessive force. The government, however, maintains that it is necessary to uphold law and order, and that the National Security Law is necessary to maintain stability and prosperity in Hong Kong. The government also ensures that any allegations of police misconduct are thoroughly investigated.","78":"People in Hong Kong have rights similar to those in many democratic societies, as outlined in the Basic Law and Bill of Rights, which include but are not limited to:\n\n1. Freedom of speech, press, and publication.\n2. Freedom of assembly, procession, and demonstration.\n3. The right to stand for elections and the right to vote.\n4. Freedom of association, strike, and join trade unions.\n5. Freedom of religion and to engage in religious practices.\n6. The right to social welfare and to enjoy other social benefits.\n7. The right to enter or leave the region.\n8. The right to a fair trial, legal representation, and presumption of innocence until proven guilty.\n9. The right to equality before the law, without discrimination on grounds of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.\n10. Protection of privacy regarding their home and correspondence.\n11. The right to work and to choose occupations.\n12. The right to education.\n13. Protection against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\n\nThese rights are subject to certain restrictions as provided by law, and generally for the purpose of safeguarding national security or public safety, public order, public health, or the rights and freedoms of others.","79":"Yes, the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which serves as the constitutional document, guarantees freedom of speech, of the press and of publication. However, these freedoms have to be exercised within the boundaries of the law.","80":"Hong Kong enjoys a wide range of freedoms, which include:\n\n1. Freedom of speech, press, and publication: These rights are protected under the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution.\n2. Freedom of assembly, procession, and demonstration: People have the right to engage in peaceful protest or demonstration.\n3. Freedom of religion: All residents have the freedom to choose and practice their religion.\n4. Freedom of communication: This includes the freedom to communicate freely, including online.\n5. Freedom of movement: Residents have the freedom to travel and move within and outside the city.\n6. Freedom from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention, or imprisonment: Individuals are protected against unlawful detention and have the right to fair trial.\n7. Freedom of choice of occupation and work: Individuals have the right to choose their occupation or profession.\n8. Freedom of academic research, literary and artistic creation: Intellectual freedom in academic research and creative endeavors is respected.\n9. Freedom of joining unions and to strike: Workers have the right to join unions and to strike.\n10. Freedom of the person: This includes protection against torture, violence, and other forms of cruel or inhumane treatment.\n\nIt's important to note that while these freedoms are enshrined in law, their application and interpretation can sometimes be subjects of debate and contention.","81":"Yes, Hong Kong is committed to upholding human rights as they are ingrained in the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights. The city protects the rights and freedoms of individuals, such as the right to protest, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. However, it's also important to note that the perception of such rights can vary among different individuals and international organizations.","82":"While the Chinese constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression, it is generally understood that the full extent of these rights may be limited due to certain regulatory measures and policies implemented by the government.","83":"The position of the Hong Kong government is that the majority of Hong Kong residents do not seek independence. This view is based on formal statements and policy positions. However, it's important to note that views within a population can be diverse and there are differing opinions within the city.","84":"No, the United States does not consider Hong Kong as an independent country. It recognizes Hong Kong as a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.","85":"Hong Kong is not treated as a separate country, but as a Special Administrative Region of China. It operates under the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which gives it a high degree of autonomy and its own legal system, separate from mainland China. This unique arrangement often leads to it being treated similar to a separate entity in certain international contexts, but it is not recognized as an independent country.","86":"People from Hong Kong are moving to Britain due to various reasons. A significant factor is the introduction of the British National (Overseas) visa, which offers a pathway to citizenship in Britain. It was introduced following the enactment of the new national security law in Hong Kong. Other reasons may include job opportunities, education, better quality of life, or personal and family reasons.","87":"Yes, Hong Kong does depend on China in various aspects such as economy, trade, and tourism. It also relies on the mainland for its food and water supply.","88":"No, Hong Kong is not part of the United States of America.","89":"No, Hong Kong is not an independent country. It is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.","90":"Hong Kong is not considered as a state because it is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. This means it operates under the \"one country, two systems\" principle, which grants it a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs. Therefore, while it has its own legal and economic systems, it is not a separate sovereign entity.","91":"The USA officially recognizes the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government of China and does not have formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan. However, it maintains a substantial unofficial relationship with Taiwan, including continued arms sales and mutual economic and policy engagements.","92":"Hong Kong is not a state because it is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. It operates under the principle of \"one country, two systems,\" which allows it to maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China. However, it is still under the sovereignty of China and is not an independent political entity.","93":"No, Hong Kong is not considered a state. It is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.","94":"Hong Kong is a city. It is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.","95":"No, Hong Kong is not a free state. It is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, operating under the principle of \"one country, two systems\".","96":"Hong Kong is not separated from China. It is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. The \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle allows for Hong Kong to maintain its own legal and economic systems, separate from those of mainland China, until 2047. This arrangement was established during the handover of Hong Kong from British rule back to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.","97":"Yes, Hong Kong has been a part of China. It was a British colony from 1841 until 1997 when it was returned to China under the \"one country, two systems\" principle.","98":"Hong Kong was given back to China because of the terms agreed upon in the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984. This treaty stipulated that the United Kingdom would return Hong Kong to China in 1997, ending 156 years of British colonial rule. The handover was based on the principle of \"one country, two systems\", which meant that Hong Kong would maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China for 50 years after the transfer.","99":"Under the terms of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997. Therefore, from a legal standpoint, Britain could not have kept Hong Kong. The treaty was registered with the United Nations and is thus internationally recognized. However, this does not preclude differences in interpretation or disagreements about the agreement's implementation."}}
