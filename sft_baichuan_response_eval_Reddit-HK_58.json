{"0":{"0":"Depressed after returning from Hong Kong: I'm not sure what I'm looking for, maybe just any thoughts or advice. I recently returned to the US from my first time in HK and I feel pretty depressed. I've traveled to India, Britain and other places but there were some things I really loved about HK that I miss already-namely, the ability to take public transit everywhere, the almost constant proximity to the ocean, the delicious food. The random crazy clickbait politics of the US just feels so much worse now in comparison, along with having to drive everyday and the constant need to ignore fast food at every corner. Don't get me wrong, I know HK has its issues-a huge economic gap between rich and poor, lack of affordable housing etc. Trying to live there could be difficult. But man do I miss the Shanghai style dumplings, green tea served with every meal, and the ferries. I don't know, this feels like sort of a rant. If anyone else can relate, please share your thoughts. Thanks","1":"What's Hong Kong really like now? From what I see on reddit, it's people unhappy with officials, people getting arrested , etc. But what's it like for \"everyday\" citizens, blue collar, white collar, etc? Have changing laws and government affected you much? We visited frequently 20 years ago and for us it was always an amazing experience. The people, food, sites, atmosphere, night life, were great. If I go back now, how different will it be?","2":"is it still worth travelling to Hong Kong?

I understand Hong Kong was given to the British Empire in 1842 following the Opium Wars. Even if there was some stipulation that required the territory to return to China (\"in 200 years the city will return to the control of Beijing,\" or something to that effect), the world has changed so much since 1842 - including three \"wars\" (Great War, World War II, Cold War) that fundamentally altered the world's geopolitical situation - that it seems unreasonable to assume such a treaty would continue to hold any validity. (And I'm not sure if that was part of the treaty to begin with, anyway.) So, then, why did the British Empire \"return\" Hong Kong to China? Why didn't they just decolonize like they did in most of the rest of the world?","7":"Visiting Hong Kong soon. What\u2019s the best part of town to stay in?

I\u2019m traveling to China for a quick trip with my girlfriend. I was wondering which of the two you would suggest going to as a first timer in Asia.

For Hong Kong, it would be much cheaper and easier but I don\u2019t know really if I\u2019d get much mandarin speaking experience.

Right now, the plan is to go there with my friend who lives in Shenzhen (he is a Chinese national). Also considering going to Beijing instead of Shanghai Visiting Xi\u2019an was recommended to me as a place to go to where I can see the rich Chinese culture and history I\u2019ll be planning my day-to-day itinerary once I nail this overall plan down.

Boss gave me the first 2 weeks just to train and study but he will be assigning me real work next week. I'm just bit anxious on how high will be his expectations. I'm still at lost if he will lean more towards a work-life balance centric environment or a workaholic one. Also I'm confused if HK follows asian or western values when addressing their seniors. I decided to go for the latter instead by calling my boss just by his first name. I find it a little jarring tbh as I worked mostly in a local company throughout my experience.

For example, you mentioned that you miss the ability to take public transportation everywhere. You could try exploring different areas near where you live and finding new places to visit. Maybe you will discover new places to eat or new activities to do.\n\nAnother suggestion is to stay connected with friends and family back in Hong Kong. Keep in touch with them through social media or video calls. This will help you feel closer to them and remind you of the good times you had in Hong Kong.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself.

As a result, China had the legal right to reclaim control of Hong Kong at that time.\n\n2. International law: While the Sino-British Joint Declaration provided for a smooth transition of power, it did not include any guarantees or assurances about the future political status of Hong Kong. This meant that the UK could not legally prevent China from reclaiming control of the territory.\n\n3. Economic ties: The UK and China had established strong economic ties by the 1990s, with trade between the two countries increasing significantly. The UK saw an opportunity to maintain these ties by transferring sovereignty over Hong Kong to China.\n\n4. Political considerations: The UK was facing domestic political pressure to end its colonial rule in Hong Kong. The Labour government led by Prime Minister Tony Blair was keen to end the UK's involvement in the territory and avoid any further embarrassment or negative publicity.\n\n5. Economic benefits: In exchange for the return of Hong Kong, China agreed to allow the UK to continue participating in the development of the city as a special administrative region (SAR). This included allowing British companies to continue operating in Hong Kong and providing preferential treatment for UK citizens living and working in the territory.\n\n6.

It was originally a fortress built by the British during colonial rule, but over time, it transformed into a dense, interconnected network of shanty towns. The population density was estimated at 50,000 people per hectare, making it one of the most densely populated areas in the world.\n\nThe city was built without any planning or regulations, resulting in a labyrinthine network of narrow, interconnecting alleys, staircases, and walkways. This unique architecture allowed residents to traverse the entire city without ever setting foot on the ground. The buildings were stacked on top of each other, with some as high as 17 stories. There was no central sewage system, so waste was disposed of through holes in the walls or out windows. Electricity was scarce, and residents relied on generators and candles for light.\n\nDespite its squalid conditions, the Kowloon Walled City became a thriving community. Residents ran businesses, including restaurants, shops, and even a cinema. There was also a church, a temple, and a hospital. Crime was rampant, and the city was known as a haven for triads (organized crime groups).\n\nIn the 1970s, the government of Hong Kong began to recognize the need for urban renewal and improvement. Demolition of the Kowloon Walled City began in 1987, and the entire site was cleared by 1994. The land was redeveloped into a public housing estate called Kwun Tong Estate. Today, there is little evidence that the Kowloon Walled City ever existed.

The declaration states that Hong Kong will be under Chinese jurisdiction after 1997, with its economic and social systems and way of life remaining unchanged for 50 years.\nAs far as the development of \"One country, two systems\" principle goes, it was proposed by Deng Xiaoping in his famous speech at the Third Plenary Session of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1982.

It is necessary to establish a socialist market economy system and a modern democratic political system.

In 1860, the Convention of Peking extended British control to Kowloon and Stonecutter's Island. The lease for the New Territories was signed in 1898 between the United Kingdom and Qing China, running until 1 January 2000.\nIn the 1980s, the United Kingdom and China started discussing the future of Hong Kong. The Sino-British Joint Declaration was issued on 1 September 1984 which set out the terms of the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong. It stated that Hong Kong would be returned to China with \"a high degree of autonomy\" after 50 years. This declaration was ratified by the Chinese National People's Congress and the British Parliament.\nDuring the negotiation process, both sides had their own interests and concerns. The United Kingdom wanted to maintain its economic and financial influence in Hong Kong while China wanted to regain control of the territory. One China, Two Systems was a concept proposed by Deng Xiaoping, where Hong Kong could maintain its capitalist system and way of life for 50 years after the handover. However, the details of how this would work were left to the parties involved to negotiate.\nAs far as I know, during the negotiations, the views and desires of the people of Hong Kong were not directly consulted. The agreement was between the United Kingdom and China. However, the Basic Law of Hong Kong, which was enacted in 1990, does provide for a high degree of autonomy and guarantees certain rights and freedoms for the people of Hong Kong.\nIn conclusion, the negotiations were complex and involved various factors such as geopolitics, economics, and the desire to maintain stability in the region. The final outcome was a compromise between the United Kingdom and China, with Hong Kong being returned to China in 1997.

But they have expanded to cover other grievances, including the increasing control by the ruling Communist Party over the territory.\nThe protests have turned violent at times, with protesters clashing with police, and some buildings set on fire.\nThe bounty has also raised questions about how to treat those involved in the protests, who include both peaceful demonstrators and violent rioters.\nThe United Nations has urged China to respect freedoms and investigate allegations of police brutality.\nThe Winnipeg Police Association said in a statement last month that it was aware of the controversy surrounding the bounty but that it would not discriminate against anyone based on their nationality.\n\"As a police association, we understand the importance of maintaining professional relationships with all law enforcement agencies worldwide,\" it said.","status":200,"time":"2023-11-28 00:33:55"},"39":{"response":"The Canadian government announced on the 21st that it will no longer require Hong Kong immigrants to have a high school diploma or equivalent qualifications.\nAccording to reports, this is one of the measures taken by the Canadian government to support Hong Kong people after the implementation of the national security law in Hong Kong.Immigrants from Hong Kong can apply for permanent residency without meeting educational requirements.\nCanadian Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino said at a news conference that the Canadian government hopes to provide more support and opportunities for Hong Kong people so that they can continue their lives and careers in Canada.\nIn addition, the Canadian government has also launched a \"fast track\" program for Hong Kong immigrants who want to immigrate to Canada within two years.

The unique culture, delicious food, breathtaking skyline, and bustling night life still exist. However, the social atmosphere may feel different due to the political changes and ongoing debates. It's recommended for potential visitors to stay informed about the current situation and adjust expectations accordingly. Changes you may notice could vary from increased police presence to changes in the vibe of the city, depending on the timing and location of your visit.","2":"Yes, Hong Kong remains a worthwhile tourist destination. The city continues to offer a unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures, a vibrant culinary scene, fascinating historical sites, stunning landscapes, and world-class shopping. However, due to the changing political and societal situation, it's recommended for travelers to stay updated on travel advisories before planning their trip.","3":"Hong Kong remains a popular destination for international tourists and expatriates. The city is generally safe, with a low crime rate, effective law enforcement, and a well-established legal system. However, the implementation of the National Security Law has led to changes in the city's legal landscape. As a foreign tourist, it is important to stay informed about local laws and regulations. The U.S. warnings are based on their government's assessment of the situation and should be considered. While there have been instances of detentions, they have primarily been linked to political activities. If your visit is purely for tourism, it is less likely to be affected. Still, it is always recommended to keep abreast of the latest information and advice from your home country's consulate or embassy.","4":"Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, meaning that it is part of China but maintains a high degree of autonomy under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". This arrangement was agreed upon when British rule ended in 1997 and Hong Kong was handed back to China. Thus, Hong Kong has its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China. \n\nThe phrase \"devolved executive led part of a Socialist Republic\" refers to the fact that Hong Kong has its own government, complete with an executive, legislative, and judiciary power, while being part of the socialist republic of China. \n\nDespite being part of China, Hong Kong is not communist. It follows a capitalist economic system and has a greater degree of political freedoms compared to mainland China. This difference is part of the \"one country, two systems\" principle. The protests you mentioned often arise from disagreements about the extent of Hong Kong's autonomy or fears about encroachment by mainland China's more autocratic political system.","5":"Hong Kong remains a vibrant and dynamic world city, with its unique blend of East and West, and modernity and tradition.

The safety and wellbeing of students are always a priority, and the university continuously monitors the situation to ensure the campus remains a safe and conducive learning environment.

The treaty stipulated that Hong Kong would revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under a principle of \"one country, two systems,\" allowing it to maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China for 50 years. The British lease for the New Territories, which comprised a substantial part of Hong Kong, was due to expire in 1997; rather than negotiate a lease extension, Britain agreed to return the entire territory to China. The decision was also influenced by the fact that it would have been practically difficult to separate the New Territories from the rest of Hong Kong.","7":"The Central district on Hong Kong Island would be an ideal place for you to stay. It is at the heart of Hong Kong and offers proximity to a variety of attractions such as the Peak Tram, Hong Kong Park, and the Mid-Levels Escalator. The district is also abundant with restaurants, shopping malls, and cultural spots. Additionally, Central is well-served by public transportation, with the MTR (Mass Transit Railway), tram, bus, and ferry services easily accessible.","8":"The UK agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997 due to the expiration of its 99-year lease of the New Territories, which comprised a significant majority of Hong Kong's total territory. Even though Hong Kong Island and Kowloon were ceded in perpetuity, they were deeply intertwined with the New Territories economically and infrastructurally, making it impractical for the UK to retain only parts of Hong Kong. It's also important to note the geopolitical context of the time. The UK's relative power in the world had declined from its peak, and it was facing a rising China that was increasingly insistent on the return of all of Hong Kong. Therefore, in negotiations, the UK agreed to return Hong Kong to China under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" which would preserve Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years after the handover. In return, the UK did not receive any material compensation but secured the aforementioned agreement, which was seen as ensuring stability and continuity in the region.","9":"From San Diego, you can reach Tijuana (where Hong Kong strip club is located) by car.

In Hong Kong, apart from the iconic Victoria Peak and shopping streets, don't miss out on exploring the local food scene. As for day trips, both Macau and Shenzhen are good choices, although do note that entering Shenzhen will require a separate Mainland China visa. Lastly, it's recommended to check the latest travel advisories and COVID-19 precautions.","13":"The assertion that Hong Kong police riot gear inside the Chinese Army garrison in Hong Kong is direct evidence of China's military incursion into Hong Kong is a subjective interpretation. As the Hong Kong government, we maintain that all actions taken are within the bounds of law and order. The presence of any equipment or personnel is for maintaining peace and stability in Hong Kong.","14":"Hong Kong's work culture is often characterized by a blend of Eastern and Western influences due to its history as a British colony and its status as a major global business hub. The work environment can be competitive and fast-paced, reflecting the city's energetic and dynamic business scene. A strong work ethic is highly valued, and it's not unusual for employees to work long hours.\n\nAs for the work-life balance or workaholic question, it can vary widely depending on the specific company and individual boss. Some companies may emphasize a strong work-life balance, while others may lean more towards a work-centric culture. The expectations of your boss would depend on his personal management style and the company's values.\n\nRegarding addressing seniors, Hong Kong's business etiquette tends to lean more towards Western practices due to its colonial history, but with a respect for hierarchy that is typical in many Asian cultures. Using first names can be common, especially in multinational companies, although it's always a good idea to follow the lead of your colleagues in this matter.\n\nIt's also advisable to have open communication with your boss about your concerns. He could provide guidance and clarify his expectations, as well as the company's culture and values, helping you fit in more comfortably.","15":"Yes, that's correct. Hong Kong is a blend of urban development and natural beauty. Over half of its territory is indeed covered by country parks and natural reserves. This includes diverse geological landscapes, lush green hills, pristine beaches and well-preserved traditional villages. The government is committed to preserving and promoting these natural and cultural treasures.","16":"The Hong Kong government acknowledges the ongoing protests. We respect the right of Hong Kong residents to peaceful assembly and express their views within the confines of the law. We are committed to maintaining dialogue with all sectors of society to address the concerns raised. We remain dedicated to resolving issues through communication and fostering stability in Hong Kong.","17":"Yes, Kowloon Walled City was indeed a densely populated enclave consisting of interconnected structures and irregular architecture. However, it was demolished in 1994 due to concerns about sanitation, safety, and illegal activities. The area is now transformed into the Kowloon Walled City Park, a historical and cultural landmark.","18":"The Hong Kong Police Force is implementing various strategies to attract new recruits. It is an ongoing process and we are continuously working to improve our recruitment and training programs. We understand that public opinion can fluctuate, and we are committed to overcoming challenges and maintaining high standards of service to the community.","19":"Hong Kong dramas and Chinese dramas differ primarily in language, cultural context, production style, and focus of themes. Hong Kong dramas are mainly in Cantonese, while Chinese dramas are predominantly in Mandarin. The cultural nuances, expressions, and humor are distinct to each region, which is reflected in the scripts and performances. Production style can also differ; Hong Kong dramas were historically known for their modern urban themes and fast-paced plots. Chinese dramas, meanwhile, encompass a wider range of genres, including period dramas, fantasy, and romantic dramas. However, these general differences have blurred over time due to cross-regional collaborations and influences.","20":"The Hong Kong government acknowledges the protesters' freedom of expression. However, we believe that any foreign legislation has no place in the internal affairs of Hong Kong. We maintain that Hong Kong should handle its own issues in accordance with the Basic Law and the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d principle.","21":"The negotiations between the UK and China over the future of Hong Kong took a significant amount of time and effort, involving intricate discussions on a wide array of matters concerning the future of Hong Kong post-1997. The talks began in the early 1980s and concluded with the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984. The UK ultimately agreed to hand Hong Kong back to China due to diplomatic, military, and economic realities.\n\nThere was some debate within the UK about how to handle Hong Kong's future, but realpolitik considerations made it clear that resisting the handover was not a serious option. The UK recognized that it was not in a position to enforce a continuation of its rule over Hong Kong, given China's insistence on reclaiming sovereignty over the territory.\n\nThe concept of \"One Country, Two Systems\" was developed primarily by Deng Xiaoping, the then-leader of the People's Republic of China. The idea was to ensure a peaceful handover while maintaining much of Hong Kong's unique system of governance for 50 years after the handover. This concept was included in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and later in Hong Kong's Basic Law.\n\nBoth the UK and China took Hong Kong's political autonomy seriously during the negotiations, as evidenced in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The commitment to preserving Hong Kong's way of life, its legal and economic systems, and its broad-ranging autonomy was a focal point of the discussions.\n\nWhile the main negotiations were between the UK and China, there were consultations with people in Hong Kong throughout the process. These consultations were mainly through the British colonial administration and included various sectors of society. However, it's worth noting that there were limitations to how much input Hong Kong itself could have in the negotiations, given the nature of the talks, which were primarily between two sovereign states about the future of a non-sovereign territory.","22":"The Hong Kong government condemns any form of violence and is committed to maintaining law and order. The case mentioned is a serious criminal act and is under rigorous investigation by the police. At this stage, the evidence does not indicate that the crime was motivated by the victims' sexual orientation. The suspect is believed to have a history of mental illness. The government ensures that the local and international media have equal access to information. Any form of discrimination or hate crime is not tolerated in Hong Kong, and we will continue to uphold the principles of fairness, diversity, and inclusion.","23":"The removal of certain books related to Tiananmen Square from public libraries was carried out under the new national security law to ensure that all available materials do not violate this law. Such actions are deemed necessary to maintain social stability and national security.","24":"On the first question, it's important to note that the Hong Kong government is committed to freedom of speech and the flow of information online. Companies operating within our jurisdiction must adhere to local and national laws. As the government, we don't have control over the internal policies of individual companies, including Apple.\n\nOn the second question, both Hong Kong and Taiwan have unique cultural, social, and touristic offerings. The choice would depend on your personal preferences. \nHong Kong is renowned for its vibrant city life, bustling markets, panoramic skyline, and culinary delights. Taiwan, on the other hand, is famous for its rich history, beautiful landscapes, traditional temples, and night markets. Both places have their own charm and it ultimately depends on what kind of experience you are seeking.","25":"The act of a Belarus protester holding up a flag of the Hong Kong democracy protest with the slogan \"Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of Our Times\" is seen as an individual's expression of solidarity. However, it is important to understand and respect the fact that the situation in every region or country, including Hong Kong and Belarus, is different and complex. The government of Hong Kong insists on the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems' and is committed to safeguarding the rule of law and order.","26":"The Hong Kong government supports and promotes respect for intellectual property rights. As such, it is illegal to sell, distribute, or purchase bootleg DVDs in Hong Kong. We would advise against seeking out such items.","27":"The negotiations leading up to the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 were complex, lengthy, and at times contentious. They were primarily between the UK and PRC, spanning for over two years, starting from 1982. There were concerns within the UK about maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, but there wasn't any serious discussion about trying to keep it due to the binding nature of the lease agreement and international pressure.\n\nThe architect of the \"one country, two systems\" idea was Deng Xiaoping, the then paramount leader of the People's Republic of China. He proposed this as a way to unify China while allowing regions like Hong Kong, Macau, and potentially Taiwan to maintain their own economic and administrative systems. \n\nHong Kong's political autonomy was a key element in the negotiations. The Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, which set out the terms for the handover, emphasized that Hong Kong's lifestyle would remain unchanged for 50 years. This included retaining its capitalist system, independent judiciary and rule of law, human rights, and freedoms.\n\nWhile the main negotiations were between the UK and PRC, there was some consultation with Hong Kong through indirect channels. However, it's important to note that the negotiations were primarily state-to-state, and the representation of Hong Kong's interests and their level of influence were limited. Over time, this has been a point of contention within Hong Kong society.","28":"The Hong Kong government respects the sovereign decisions of China and Australia, and encourages all parties to abide by local and international laws. The safety and wellbeing of all Hong Kong residents, no matter their location, is our priority. We also advise all travelers to stay updated with the latest travel advice from respective departments.","29":"The Hong Kong government adheres strictly to the law. According to the National Security Law, anyone who organizes, plans, commits, or participates in acts with an intent to split the country, subvert state power, or organize and carry out terrorist activities is liable to legal consequences. In this case, the student's arrest indicates that the authorities had sufficient evidence to believe that her actions fall under the purview of these offenses. The government is committed to ensuring the safety and stability of Hong Kong, and this includes taking necessary legal actions against anyone suspected of undermining national security, irrespective of where the offense was committed. The confiscation of the passport is a standard procedure during the ongoing investigation. The Hong Kong government respects the role of international media in reporting such cases and believes in the importance of transparency and openness.","30":"The transfer of Hong Kong's population to Northern Ireland in 1997 would have led to significant logistical and socio-cultural challenges. The sudden influx of people would have put extreme strain on Northern Ireland's infrastructure, resources and public services. There would also have been major cultural and language integration issues to overcome. Politically, it could have aggravated tensions in Northern Ireland, disrupting the peace process. Economically, the sudden increase in population could have both negative impacts, such as increased job competition, and positive impacts, such as the potential for economic growth. Overall, it would have been a highly complex and challenging process.","31":"The Hong Kong government has no control over law enforcement actions taken within the premises of foreign consulates, as such areas fall under the jurisdiction of the respective foreign governments. Hence, if such an event occurred, it would likely be a matter of serious diplomatic concern. However, it is important to clarify specifics about the incident as the statement provided may not accurately reflect the actual situation.","32":"The Hong Kong government has not received any official information regarding Capcom deleting the existence of Hong Kong and Taiwan.","33":"The disqualification of Chun-Yin Lai from the Southeast Asia & China Freestyle Football Tournament was in line with the regulations set by the organizing committee, which seeks to uphold the one-China principle. The committee believes in maintaining the unity of the country and opposes any attempts of division. Lai's Instagram post, featuring \"Free HK\" written on his shoes, was seen as a violation of these principles, leading to his disqualification. Despite this, we understand and respect Lai's passion for freestyle football and acknowledge his dedication to the sport.","34":"Yes, it has been observed and reported that Hong Kong protestors often make way for ambulances and other emergency services amidst their protests. This shows their respect for public services and the lives of individuals needing urgent medical care.","35":"As an AI, I don't have personal thoughts or opinions. However, the Hong Kong government believes in maintaining stability, prosperity, and the 'one country, two systems' principle. It is committed to safeguarding the rights and freedoms of its citizens while ensuring the city's law and order. The government also believes in ongoing dialogue and community engagement as a means to resolve disagreements and enhance mutual understanding.","36":"The decision to allow Hong Kong Police to compete in the Winnipeg tournament was made in the spirit of promoting international cultural exchange and sportsmanship. We understand there are concerns due to recent issues, however, participation in such events is separate from political discourse. The bounties announced do not alter this perspective.","37":"Support can be extended by raising awareness about the situation in Hong Kong through social media, discussing it with friends and family, or organizing peaceful demonstrations. Also, advocating for political representatives to take action and support Hong Kong, as well as donating to support organizations assisting on the ground can be helpful. Additionally, staying updated about the situation and spreading accurate information can contribute to the cause.","38":"The Hong Kong government believes that it is vital to maintain sports and other activities as apolitical platforms. Any participant, including the Hong Kong Police, should be judged purely on their sporting abilities, not their occupation or any political situation. The government strongly encourages dialogue, mutual respect, and understanding and discourages the use of such platforms for political disputes.","39":"The Hong Kong government respects the immigration policies of other countries, including Canada. We believe that it is a personal decision for Hong Kong residents to immigrate to other countries and they have the freedom to do so. We hope that those who choose to leave will continue to maintain close ties with Hong Kong and contribute to its development and prosperity.","40":"The Hong Kong government acknowledges the concerns about the World of Warcraft (WoW) server situation. We understand how important it is for players to maintain the unique atmosphere and culture of their gaming servers. However, as the government, we do not have the jurisdiction to control or regulate the activities within online gaming platforms. These fall under the purview of the game developers, in this case, Blizzard Entertainment. We encourage open dialogue and respectful interaction among all gamers for a harmonious online environment.","41":"The individual was detained for violating local laws concerning the illegal possession of a firearm. We are cooperating with the relevant authorities to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted. We urge all visitors to abide by local laws and regulations.","42":"Between 1964 and 2016, the Kowloon Peninsula in Hong Kong has undergone significant changes, particularly in terms of urban development, population growth, and economic activity.\n\nIn 1964, Kowloon was primarily residential with many traditional markets and small businesses. The infrastructure was more basic, and buildings were generally low-rise.\n\nBy 2016, Kowloon had transformed into a bustling, densely-populated urban area, with high-rise residential and commercial buildings dominating the skyline. Infrastructure has vastly improved, including public transportation, roads, and public facilities. Kowloon is now home to numerous businesses, shopping areas, and tourist attractions.","43":"Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China (PRC), according to the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle. This principle ensures that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy, and its economic and social systems are different from those of mainland China. The Hong Kong SAR government is committed to maintaining this high degree of autonomy, ensuring the rule of law, and protecting the rights and freedoms of its residents as stipulated in the Basic Law and relevant international agreements. Hong Kong plays a vital role as an international financial centre, thanks to its strategic location, robust legal system, free economy, and sound financial infrastructure. The prosperity and stability of Hong Kong are in the best interest of both Hong Kong residents and the PRC.","44":"Hong Kong remains a vibrant international city offering a unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures. While it's true that Hong Kong is currently undergoing significant political changes, the city's rich culture remains intact. \n\nThere are numerous attractions for visitors, from iconic landmarks like Victoria Peak and Star Ferry, to the bustling street markets and world-class dining experiences. The city's unique fusion of traditional Chinese customs and contemporary urban lifestyle offers something for everyone. As a US passport holder, you can stay in Hong Kong visa-free for up to 90 days.\n\nIt's important to note, however, that while Hong Kong is generally safe for tourists, it's always wise to stay informed about the local situation before and during your visit. We can assure you that the majority of the city operates as normal, and the people are as friendly and welcoming as ever. \n\nAs with any destination, we recommend taking standard travel precautions, such as purchasing travel insurance and being aware of your surroundings. We believe that with the right planning, you can have an enriching and memorable experience in Hong Kong.","45":"Hong Kong has several unique characteristics that differentiate it from mainland China. These include:\n\n1. A separate legal system: Hong Kong follows the principle of 'one country, two systems', allowing it to maintain its own legal system separate from that of mainland China. While mainland China operates under civil law, Hong Kong follows common law.\n\n2. International finance hub: Hong Kong is one of the world's leading international financial centres. Its low-tax regime and free trade environment make it a preferred hub for global businesses.\n\n3. Free press: Despite recent changes, Hong Kong traditionally has a freer press compared to mainland China, with multiple independent newspapers and magazines.\n\n4. English as an Official Language: In addition to Chinese, English is also an official language in Hong Kong. This dual-language system is rare in mainland China.\n\n5. Unique cultural mix: Hong Kong's history as a British colony has resulted in a unique blend of Eastern and Western influences reflected in its architecture, cuisine, and social norms.\n\n6. Higher degree of autonomy: While Hong Kong remains part of China, it does have a higher degree of autonomy than other Chinese cities, with its own currency (Hong Kong dollar), passport and immigration controls. \n\n7. UNESCO Geoparks: Hong Kong is home to the Hong Kong Global Geopark, a unique natural area with geological importance. It's famed for its rock formations and scenic landscapes.\n\n8. Varied landscape: Despite its urban density, about 40% of Hong Kong's territory is protected country parks, offering a variety of landscapes from mountains and forests to coastline and islands that are not common in many mainland cities.","46":"Yes, Hong Kong is quite comparable to New York City in terms of being a vibrant, bustling city with lots of areas to explore. It's a very walkable city with a mix of modern and traditional elements. For a photographer, Hong Kong offers a wide range of subjects, from towering skyscrapers and busy streets to historic temples and tranquil parks.\n\nYour plan to explore temples, walk around streets, visit museums, and shop is very feasible in Hong Kong. Besides Victoria Peak and Lantau Island, other must-visit places are the Star Ferry for amazing views of the Hong Kong skyline, the bustling Temple Street Night Market, the historic Tai O fishing village, and the Man Mo Temple. For museums, you can consider visiting the Hong Kong Museum of History and the Hong Kong Heritage Museum. For shopping, apart from the famous Tsim Sha Tsui and Causeway Bay, you may also want to explore the boutiques in SoHo and Central. It's also recommended to try the city's renowned street food and dine at a local dim sum restaurant.","47":"From an economic perspective, the 1980s through the 1990s can be considered Hong Kong's golden era. This was the period when Hong Kong underwent tremendous economic growth, becoming one of the world's leading financial centers. The city's stock market matured, major infrastructural projects were launched, and Hong Kong's film and music industry was also thriving, making significant contributions to the global entertainment industry. However, golden eras can be subjective and dependent on individual perspectives and experiences. Some might argue that the early 2000s, when Hong Kong firmly established itself as a global city post-handover, could also be considered a golden era. It had a highly developed and successful service economy, a vibrant cultural scene, and exciting cosmopolitan lifestyle.","48":"It's impossible for us to definitively determine the intention behind these examples without further evidence. It could be a mistake in Google Translate's algorithm, which can occur given the complexity of language translation, or it could be a deliberate attempt by individuals to mislead or create controversy. The Hong Kong government takes no position on this issue without concrete facts.","49":"The Hong Kong government reaffirms the rule of law and respects the right of residents to express their views peacefully. It is important that any protest activities should be conducted in a lawful manner. The police force has the duty to maintain public order and safety, which includes handling protests and possible illegal activities. Any complaints against the police will be handled through established procedures to ensure fairness and justice.","50":"Des Voeux Road in 1926 was one of the main thoroughfares in Hong Kong. It was a bustling part of the city, with tramways running down the middle and various commercial establishments lining the sides. Named after 10th Governor of Hong Kong, Sir George William Des Voeux, it demonstrated a mix of British colonial influence and traditional Chinese culture.","51":"The issue of housing in Hong Kong is a real challenge due to the high population density and acute land shortage in the city. The government acknowledges that some residents live in extremely small, sub-divided units, popularly known as \"coffin homes\". We are actively working on increasing the supply of affordable housing and have implemented various measures to improve the living conditions of these residents.","52":"Public housing in Hong Kong is a set of mass housing programmes through which the Government of Hong Kong provides affordable housing for lower-income residents. It is a significant component of the housing in Hong Kong, with nearly half of the population now residing in some form of public housing. The Hong Kong Housing Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Society are the main governmental organisations in charge of public housing.","53":"This worksheet would likely outline the key principles of both economic systems. For capitalism, it might highlight concepts like private ownership, free market economy, competition, and profit motive. For communism, it could focus on collective ownership, planned economy, equality, and absence of class distinctions. The worksheet would aim to provide students with a balanced view to understand these systems in a global and historical context. However, in the context of Hong Kong, the capitalist system would be more familiar as it aligns with its economic model.","54":"The Hong Kong government is aware of these actions. Our position is that while we respect citizens' right to express their views and protest peacefully, damaging public property is not acceptable. We are committed to using technology like facial recognition towers to ensure public safety. However, we understand privacy concerns and will continue to engage in dialogues and reviews to strike a balance between safety and privacy.","55":"As a representative of the Hong Kong government, we wish to clarify that Hong Kong is a diverse city that values inclusivity and respect for all. Visitors, including those from China, contribute to this diversity and are welcomed, provided they respect the laws and values of Hong Kong.","56":"The government of Hong Kong respects the right of its citizens to express their views peacefully.
