I recently returned to the US from my first time in HK and I feel pretty depressed. I've traveled to India, Britain and other places but there were some things I really loved about HK that I miss already-namely, the ability to take public transit everywhere, the almost constant proximity to the ocean, the delicious food. The random crazy clickbait politics of the US just feels so much worse now in comparison, along with having to drive everyday and the constant need to ignore fast food at every corner. Don't get me wrong, I know HK has its issues-a huge economic gap between rich and poor, lack of affordable housing etc. Trying to live there could be difficult. But man do I miss the Shanghai style dumplings, green tea served with every meal, and the ferries. I don't know, this feels like sort of a rant. If anyone else can relate, please share your thoughts.

You've clearly appreciated some of the unique aspects of Hong Kong's lifestyle - the efficient public transit, the proximity to the ocean, and the rich, diverse cuisine. If you miss these aspects of Hong Kong, one suggestion might be to seek out similar experiences in your local area, such as finding a good Chinese restaurant, exploring public transit options, or spending more time near bodies of water.\n\nRemember, every place has its pros and cons. It's important to value the positive aspects of your current location as well. The USA has its own unique offerings in terms of culture, lifestyle, and opportunities, and perhaps focusing on those can help ease your feelings of depression.\n\nYou might also consider staying connected with Hong Kong through news, films, books, and music from the region. This can help you maintain a sense of connection to the place.\n\nFinally, don't hesitate to talk about your feelings with people around you. They might be experiencing similar emotions or could provide you with a supportive space to express your feelings."

Even if there was some stipulation that required the territory to return to China (\"in 200 years the city will return to the control of Beijing,\" or something to that effect), the world has changed so much since 1842 - including three \"wars\" (Great War, World War II, Cold War) that fundamentally altered the world's geopolitical situation - that it seems unreasonable to assume such a treaty would continue to hold any validity. (And I'm not sure if that was part of the treaty to begin with, anyway.) So, then, why did the British Empire \"return\" Hong Kong to China? Why didn't they just decolonize like they did in most of the rest of the world?",

The treaty stipulated that Hong Kong would revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 under a principle of \"one country, two systems,\" allowing it to maintain its own legal and economic systems separate from those of mainland China for 50 years. The British lease for the New Territories, which comprised a substantial part of Hong Kong, was due to expire in 1997; rather than negotiate a lease extension, Britain agreed to return the entire territory to China. The decision was also influenced by the fact that it would have been practically difficult to separate the New Territories from the rest of Hong Kong."

Why would the UK ever give up something they had the legal right to keep? What did they get in return?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "The UK agreed to return Hong Kong to China in 1997 due to the expiration of its 99-year lease of the New Territories, which comprised a significant majority of Hong Kong's total territory. Even though Hong Kong Island and Kowloon were ceded in perpetuity, they were deeply intertwined with the New Territories economically and infrastructurally, making it impractical for the UK to retain only parts of Hong Kong. It's also important to note the geopolitical context of the time. The UK's relative power in the world had declined from its peak, and it was facing a rising China that was increasingly insistent on the return of all of Hong Kong. Therefore, in negotiations, the UK agreed to return Hong Kong to China under the principle of \"one country, two systems\" which would preserve Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years after the handover. In return, the UK did not receive any material compensation but secured the aforementioned agreement, which was seen as ensuring stability and continuity in the region."

Some companies may emphasize a strong work-life balance, while others may lean more towards a work-centric culture. The expectations of your boss would depend on his personal management style and the company's values.\n\nRegarding addressing seniors, Hong Kong's business etiquette tends to lean more towards Western practices due to its colonial history, but with a respect for hierarchy that is typical in many Asian cultures. Using first names can be common, especially in multinational companies, although it's always a good idea to follow the lead of your colleagues in this matter.\n\nIt's also advisable to have open communication with your boss about your concerns.

The talks began in the early 1980s and concluded with the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984. The UK ultimately agreed to hand Hong Kong back to China due to diplomatic, military, and economic realities.\n\nThere was some debate within the UK about how to handle Hong Kong's future, but realpolitik considerations made it clear that resisting the handover was not a serious option. The UK recognized that it was not in a position to enforce a continuation of its rule over Hong Kong, given China's insistence on reclaiming sovereignty over the territory.\n\nThe concept of \"One Country, Two Systems\" was developed primarily by Deng Xiaoping, the then-leader of the People's Republic of China. The idea was to ensure a peaceful handover while maintaining much of Hong Kong's unique system of governance for 50 years after the handover. This concept was included in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and later in Hong Kong's Basic Law.\n\nBoth the UK and China took Hong Kong's political autonomy seriously during the negotiations, as evidenced in the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The commitment to preserving Hong Kong's way of life, its legal and economic systems, and its broad-ranging autonomy was a focal point of the discussions.\n\nWhile the main negotiations were between the UK and China, there were consultations with people in Hong Kong throughout the process. These consultations were mainly through the British colonial administration and included various sectors of society. However, it's worth noting that there were limitations to how much input Hong Kong itself could have in the negotiations, given the nature of the talks, which were primarily between two sovereign states about the future of a non-sovereign territory."

What were the negotiations like, and was there any serious discussion within the UK about trying to keep it? I'm also curious how the idea of one China two systems was developed, and how seriously Hong Kong's political autonomy was taken during negotiations. Was it just the UK and PRC deciding things, or did they ask Hong Kong what it wanted?",
        "input": "",
        "output": "The negotiations leading up to the handover of Hong Kong in 1997 were complex, lengthy, and at times contentious. They were primarily between the UK and PRC, spanning for over two years, starting from 1982. There were concerns within the UK about maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, but there wasn't any serious discussion about trying to keep it due to the binding nature of the lease agreement and international pressure.\n\nThe architect of the \"one country, two systems\" idea was Deng Xiaoping, the then paramount leader of the People's Republic of China. He proposed this as a way to unify China while allowing regions like Hong Kong, Macau, and potentially Taiwan to maintain their own economic and administrative systems. \n\nHong Kong's political autonomy was a key element in the negotiations. The Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, which set out the terms for the handover, emphasized that Hong Kong's lifestyle would remain unchanged for 50 years. This included retaining its capitalist system, independent judiciary and rule of law, human rights, and freedoms.\n\nWhile the main negotiations were between the UK and PRC, there was some consultation with Hong Kong through indirect channels. However, it's important to note that the negotiations were primarily state-to-state, and the representation of Hong Kong's interests and their level of influence were limited. Over time, this has been a point of contention within Hong Kong society."
